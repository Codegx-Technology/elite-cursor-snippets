Every day, the elderly woman would walk miles to fetch water from contaminated sources. This inspired Amina to study engineering. Years later, after graduating from University of Nairobi, she returned home with innovative water purification technology. She worked with her community to install solar-powered water systems.

Born in a small village where technology was scarce, he had never seen a computer until he was fifteen. His first encounter with coding happened at a community center in Narok, where a volunteer teacher introduced him to basic programming. The experience ignited a passion that would change his life forever. Determined to learn more, Kiprotich walked twenty kilometers every day to access the internet at the nearest town. He taught himself Python, JavaScript, and web development through online tutorials. His dedication caught the attention of a tech entrepreneur visiting from Nairobi. Impressed by the young man's self-taught skills and determination, she offered him a scholarship to attend a coding bootcamp in the capital. In Nairobi, Kiprotich thrived among like-minded peers and experienced mentors. He learned not just about technology, but about how it could solve real problems in his community. His final project was a mobile app that helped pastoralists track livestock health and market prices. After graduation, instead of seeking employment in multinational companies, Kiprotich returned to his village with a mission. He established a rural tech hub, teaching coding to young people who, like him, had limited access to technology education. His initiative attracted funding from international donors and government support. Within three years, over 200 young people had learned programming skills, with many going on to create their own tech solutions for agricultural, healthcare, and educational challenges in rural Kenya. Today, Kiprotich's story inspires countless others across Africa, proving that with determination, even the most remote communities can become centers of technological innovation and progress.",
