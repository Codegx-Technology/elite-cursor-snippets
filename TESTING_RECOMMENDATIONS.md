# Automated Testing Recommendations for Shujaa Studio

This document outlines the recommended automated testing procedures for both the Frontend (UI) and Backend components of the Shujaa Studio application, adhering to industry best practices and leveraging existing project dependencies.

## 1. Frontend (UI) Automated Testing Plan

**Frameworks:** Jest, React Testing Library (already present in `package.json` dev dependencies).

**Types of Tests:**

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Purpose:** To test individual React components or pure functions in isolation, ensuring they render correctly, handle props, and respond to user interactions as expected.
    *   **Scope:** Small, self-contained components (e.g., buttons, input fields, icons, utility functions).
    *   **Example:** Testing if a `Button` component renders with the correct text and calls an `onClick` handler when clicked.

*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between multiple React components, or a component's interaction with external services (like the API layer, but often mocked for faster tests). This ensures that components work together correctly.
    *   **Scope:** Larger components composed of several smaller ones, forms that handle user input and state, components that fetch data.
    *   **Example:** Testing a login form to ensure it captures user input, calls the authentication API (mocked), and navigates to the dashboard on success.

**Initial Implementation Scope:**

We will start by implementing automated tests for critical and foundational UI components and flows:

1.  **Authentication Components:** Login, Registration forms.
2.  **Video Generation Form:** Key inputs, options, and submission.
3.  **Navigation/Sidebar:** Ensuring correct routing and active states.

**Process for Frontend Testing:**

1.  **Jest Configuration (`frontend/jest.config.js`):** Create a configuration file to properly set up Jest for a Next.js/React environment, including module resolution, test environment, and transformations.
2.  **Test File Location:** Test files will be placed alongside the components they test (e.g., `src/components/auth/Login.test.tsx`) or in a dedicated `__tests__` directory.
3.  **Writing Tests:** Use `render` from React Testing Library to render components, and `screen` queries to interact with and assert on the rendered output.
4.  **Running Tests:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npx jest --watchAll # For development, runs tests on file changes
    npx jest # For CI/CD or full test run
    ```
5.  **Bug Fixing:** Any bugs identified during test runs will be reported and addressed, adhering to the `elite-cursor-snippets` methodology and context patterns.

## 2. Backend Automated Testing Plan

**Framework:** `pytest` (commonly used in Python projects, and likely compatible with existing test files if any).

**Types of Tests:**

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Purpose:** To test individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation, ensuring their logic is correct. External dependencies (like databases, external APIs) will be mocked.
    *   **Scope:** Utility functions, data models, small business logic units.
    *   **Example:** Testing a function that calculates billing based on usage, mocking the database call for usage data.

*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between different backend modules or services, ensuring they work together as expected. This often involves testing the actual database interactions or internal API calls.
    *   **Scope:** API endpoints (testing the full request-response cycle without mocking the underlying business logic), service layers interacting with repositories.
    *   **Example:** Testing an API endpoint for creating a project, ensuring it correctly saves data to the database and returns the expected response.

*   **API Tests (End-to-End for Backend):**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the public-facing API endpoints, simulating client requests and verifying the responses. This ensures the API contract is met.
    *   **Scope:** All FastAPI endpoints.
    *   **Tools:** `httpx` or `requests` within `pytest` tests.
    *   **Example:** Sending a POST request to `/api/projects` and asserting on the status code and the structure of the returned JSON.

**Initial Implementation Scope:**

We will start by implementing automated tests for critical backend components and API endpoints:

1.  **Authentication Endpoints:** User registration, login, token validation.
2.  **Project Management Endpoints:** CRUD operations for projects.
3.  **Core AI Model Manager Logic:** Testing the routing and fallback mechanisms (mocking external AI services).

**Process for Backend Testing:**

1.  **Pytest Configuration:** Ensure `pytest` is installed and configured (e.g., `pytest.ini` if needed).
2.  **Test File Location:** Test files will typically be placed in a `tests/` directory at the project root or within individual module directories (e.g., `backend/tests/test_api.py`).
3.  **Writing Tests:** Use `pytest` fixtures for setup/teardown, and `assert` statements for assertions. Use mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`) for isolating units.
4.  **Running Tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest # From the project root
    ```
5.  **Bug Fixing:** Any bugs identified during test runs will be reported and addressed, adhering to the `elite-cursor-snippets` methodology and context patterns.

## 3. General Testing Principles & Methodology

*   **Test Pyramid:** Prioritize a higher number of fast, isolated unit tests, a moderate number of integration tests, and a smaller number of slower, comprehensive end-to-end tests.
*   **Elite-Cursor-Snippets Methodology:** All test code and bug fixes will strictly follow the project's established `elite-cursor-snippets` context patterns and conventions. This includes code style, naming, and architectural considerations.
*   **Codebase Check:** Before creating any new files or making significant changes, the existing codebase will be thoroughly checked to ensure consistency and avoid redundancy.
*   **Bug Reporting & Approval:** Any bugs identified during testing will be reported to the user for approval before attempting a fix.
*   **CI/CD Integration (Future):** Once a solid suite of automated tests is established, they will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous quality and prevent regressions.
