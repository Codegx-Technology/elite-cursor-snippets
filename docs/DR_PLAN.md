# Disaster Recovery and Backup Plan

This document outlines the conceptual plan for Disaster Recovery (DR) and Backup for Shujaa Studio, ensuring business continuity and data integrity.

**Last Updated:** August 11, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This plan details the strategies and procedures to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a disaster affecting Shujaa Studio's operations.

## 2. Scope

This plan covers:
*   Application data (user profiles, project metadata, billing records, audit logs)
*   Generated assets (videos, images, audio)
*   Application code and configurations
*   AI models (local and remote access configurations)

## 3. Recovery Objectives

*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** [Define specific time, e.g., 4 hours] - The maximum tolerable duration of time that a computer, system, network or application can be down after a disaster.
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** [Define specific time, e.g., 1 hour] - The maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident.

## 4. Backup Strategy

### 4.1. Data Backups
*   **Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Frequency:** Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups.
    *   **Method:** [Specify tools, e.g., `pg_dump`, SQLite `.backup` command, or cloud provider's managed backup services].
    *   **Storage:** Encrypted, off-site storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) with versioning.
    *   **Retention:** [Define retention period, e.g., 30 days for daily, 1 year for monthly snapshots].
*   **Generated Assets (Output/Cache):**
    *   **Frequency:** Continuous synchronization to cloud storage (e.g., S3) or daily snapshots.
    *   **Method:** [Specify tools, e.g., `rsync`, cloud sync tools].
    *   **Storage:** Encrypted, geo-redundant cloud storage.

### 4.2. Code and Configuration Backups
*   **Version Control:** All application code and configuration files are stored in Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
*   **Frequency:** Continuous (on every commit).
*   **Method:** Standard Git operations.
*   **Storage:** Remote Git repository.

### 4.3. AI Model Backups
*   **Local Models:** Critical local models (if self-hosted) should be backed up to secure, off-site storage.
*   **Remote Models:** Configuration for accessing remote models (e.g., Hugging Face API IDs) should be securely backed up.

## 5. Disaster Recovery Procedures

### 5.1. Incident Response Team
*   [List key personnel and their roles in a disaster scenario].

### 5.2. Recovery Steps
1.  **Assess Impact:** Determine the extent of the disaster and affected systems.
2.  **Activate DR Environment:** Provision new infrastructure (VMs, containers, databases) in a separate region or availability zone.
3.  **Restore Data:** Restore the latest full and incremental backups to the new environment.
4.  **Deploy Application:** Deploy the application code and configurations from version control.
5.  **Configure AI Models:** Ensure AI models are accessible and configured (download/load local models, configure API access).
6.  **Verify Functionality:** Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure all services are operational.
7.  **Failover DNS:** Update DNS records to point to the new DR environment.
8.  **Monitor:** Continuously monitor the recovered system for stability and performance.

## 6. Testing and Maintenance

*   **Regular Drills:** Conduct DR drills at least [frequency, e.g., annually] to test the plan's effectiveness.
*   **Documentation Review:** Review and update this document [frequency, e.g., quarterly] to reflect changes in infrastructure or application.
*   **Backup Verification:** Periodically verify the integrity and restorability of backups.

## 7. Communication Plan

*   [Outline communication protocols for internal teams, stakeholders, and users during a disaster].

## 8. Contact Information

*   [List emergency contact details for key personnel and external vendors].
