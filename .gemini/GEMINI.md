## Elite Cursor Snippets

This project uses a set of "elite-cursor-snippets" to streamline development and ensure consistency. These snippets are located in the `.vscode` directory and are categorized into four files:

*   **`elite-prompts.code-snippets`**: Predefined prompts for interacting with the AI assistant.
*   **`Elite Prompt Setup.code-snippets`**: A comprehensive set of categorized snippets for various development tasks.
*   **`Reflective Intelligence.code-snippets`**: Snippets for personal development and team collaboration.
*   **`Smart Context Templates.code-snippets`**: Snippets for creating "context chains" to provide the AI with clear and concise context.

I will use these snippets in my workflow to be a more effective developer. I will pay special attention to the "Kenya-first" snippets to ensure that the project meets the specific needs of Kenyan users. I will also use the `Universal Prompt Dispatcher` (`autopickprefix`) to select the most appropriate snippet for each task.
