## Project State

### Super Admin Dashboard

**User Management:**
- Implemented user listing, creation, editing, and deletion functionalities in `frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/admin/users/create/page.tsx`, and `frontend/src/app/admin/users/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Leveraged `useUserManagement` hook for API interactions.

**Tenant Management:**
- Implemented tenant listing, creation, editing, and deletion functionalities in `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/create/page.tsx`, and `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Created and leveraged `useTenantManagement` hook for API interactions.
- Updated `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` to include tenant-related API methods.

**Model Update Approval & TTS Voice Management:**
- Confirmed that the existing `DependencyWatcher` component (`frontend/src/admin/components/DependencyWatcher.tsx`) is designed to handle model updates, including a `kind: "model"` in its `PatchCandidate` schema.
- Backend API (`/api/depwatcher`) supports creating, approving, dry-running, and applying patch plans for models.
- Assumed TTS voice management falls under model management within this system for now.

**Overall:** The Super Admin Dashboard is now significantly more robust and feature-rich, aligning with enterprise-grade SaaS quality.

**Commit and Push Status:** All changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.
