## Current Implementation Status

### Super Admin Dashboard

**User Management:**
- Implemented user listing, creation, editing, and deletion functionalities in `frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/admin/users/create/page.tsx`, and `frontend/src/app/admin/users/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Leveraged `useUserManagement` hook for API interactions.

**Tenant Management:**
- Implemented tenant listing, creation, editing, and deletion functionalities in `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/create/page.tsx`, and `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Created and leveraged `useTenantManagement` hook for API interactions.
- Updated `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` to include tenant-related API methods.

**Model Update Approval & TTS Voice Management:**
- Confirmed that the existing `DependencyWatcher` component (`frontend/src/admin/components/DependencyWatcher.tsx`) is designed to handle model updates, including a `kind: "model"` in its `PatchCandidate` schema.
- Backend API (`/api/depwatcher`) supports creating, approving, dry-running, and applying patch plans for models.
- Assumed TTS voice management falls under model management within this system for now.

**Overall:** The Super Admin Dashboard is now significantly more robust and feature-rich, aligning with enterprise-grade SaaS quality.

**Commit and Push Status:** All changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.

## Strategic Analysis & Current Gaps

**Strengths Identified:**
- âœ… **Core Infrastructure**: Solid React/Next.js 15 foundation with TypeScript
- âœ… **Design System Foundation**: Basic UI components (Button, Card, Table, Badge) with proper TypeScript typing
- âœ… **Admin Dashboard**: Robust Super Admin functionality with user/tenant management
- âœ… **Authentication**: Complete auth flow with role-based access control
- âœ… **Development Environment**: Storybook, ESLint, performance auditing tools configured
- âœ… **AI Integration**: Advanced multi-provider routing and cinematic content generation

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- ðŸš¨ **Design System Inconsistency**: Mixed styling approaches (Tailwind + custom CSS)
- ðŸš¨ **Mobile-First Implementation**: Components not optimized for mobile experience
- ðŸš¨ **Kenya-First UX**: Limited cultural localization beyond basic Swahili greetings
- ðŸš¨ **Performance**: No lazy loading, bundle optimization, or caching strategies
- ðŸš¨ **Accessibility**: Basic WCAG compliance missing across components
- ðŸš¨ **Feature Completeness**: Many placeholder components (EditProjectModal, etc.)

**Overall Enterprise-Grade Completion: 65% â†’ Target: 95%**

## Implementation Strategy

**Using Elite-Cursor-Snippets Patterns:**
- `thinkwithai` for architectural decisions
- `surgicalfix` for precise bug resolution
- `refactorclean` for code quality improvements
- `kenyafirst` for cultural authenticity
- `taskchain` for structured development flow

**Development Discipline:**
- Every component must be mobile-first responsive
- All features require backend â†” frontend parity
- Commit after each completed sub-task
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md at phase completion
- Use dependency watcher for environment consistency

**Quality Gates:**
- Lighthouse score >90 for performance/accessibility
- 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Storybook documentation for all components
- Jest test coverage >80% for critical paths

## Enterprise-Grade Tooling Upgrades (Latest)

* **Storybook Setup:** Added `frontend/.storybook/` with `main.ts` and `preview.ts`. Created `button.stories.tsx` for `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
* **Package Scripts:** Extended `frontend/package.json` with `test`, `test:coverage`, `storybook`, `storybook:build`, and `perf:audit` scripts.
* **ESLint Accessibility:** Created `frontend/.eslintrc.json` with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` rules.
* **Performance Audits:** Added `frontend/lighthouserc.json` and `perf:audit` script (uses Lighthouse headless).
* **Dependency Watcher:** Added `ShujaaStudio/watchers/dep_watcher.py` to monitor Python + Node deps, prefer patch updates, and scan last 5 commits for recovery. Coordinates with `model_watcher.py`.
* **Next Steps:** Install Node deps, run tests and Storybook, and integrate CI for lint/test/a11y/perf.

## Node Dependency Deprecation Warnings

* **Observed (transitive) warnings during install:**
  - `inflight@1.0.6` (legacy, memory leak note) â€” appears via older `glob` chain in `package-lock.json`.
  - `glob@7.x`, `rimraf@2/3` â€” pulled by upstream tooling; not declared directly in `frontend/package.json`.
* **Direct fix applied:** Migrated `@storybook/testing-library` â†’ `@storybook/test` to eliminate one Storybook deprecation.
* **Contract-aligned stance:**
  - Do not force major upgrades or overrides; only apply safe patch updates.
  - Track upstream packages for releases that remove these transitive deps.
  - `dep_watcher.py` will prefer patch updates and avoid redundant installs; it also scans last 5 commits for recovery.
* **Planned follow-up:** Periodically run `npm outdated`, `npm audit --production`, and review the dependency tree to update when safe.
