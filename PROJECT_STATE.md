## Project State

### Super Admin Dashboard

**User Management:**
- Implemented user listing, creation, editing, and deletion functionalities in `frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/admin/users/create/page.tsx`, and `frontend/src/app/admin/users/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Leveraged `useUserManagement` hook for API interactions.

**Tenant Management:**
- Implemented tenant listing, creation, editing, and deletion functionalities in `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/create/page.tsx`, and `frontend/src/app/admin/tenants/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
- Created and leveraged `useTenantManagement` hook for API interactions.
- Updated `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` to include tenant-related API methods.

**Model Update Approval & TTS Voice Management:**
- Confirmed that the existing `DependencyWatcher` component (`frontend/src/admin/components/DependencyWatcher.tsx`) is designed to handle model updates, including a `kind: "model"` in its `PatchCandidate` schema.
- Backend API (`/api/depwatcher`) supports creating, approving, dry-running, and applying patch plans for models.
- Assumed TTS voice management falls under model management within this system for now.

**Overall:** The Super Admin Dashboard is now significantly more robust and feature-rich, aligning with enterprise-grade SaaS quality.

**Commit and Push Status:** All changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.

## Enterprise-Grade UI Development Status

Based on the current state and the broad definition of "enterprise-grade SaaS quality" from `gemini.md`, here's a high-level estimation of remaining work:

1.  **Core UI Components & Design System (Currently ~40% complete)**:
    *   **Current Status**: Basic components (`button`, `card`, `badge`, etc.) are present and well-structured. Some admin UI is robust.
    *   **Remaining (60%)**:
        *   **Expansion**: Develop a wider range of complex, reusable components (e.g., advanced tables with sorting/filtering, complex forms, data visualization components, rich text editors, media players).
        *   **Consistency & Documentation**: Formalize design tokens, create comprehensive documentation (Storybook/Style Guide) for all components, ensuring consistent usage and accessibility guidelines.
        *   **Theming**: Implement a robust theming solution if multiple themes are required (e.g., light/dark mode, custom branding).

2.  **Overall Application UI/UX Refinement (Currently ~30% complete)**:
    *   **Current Status**: Basic layouts and navigation exist. Admin dashboards have some functionality.
    *   **Remaining (70%)**:
        *   **User Flows**: Optimize and refine all critical user flows (e.g., video generation, asset upload/management, billing, user profile) for intuitiveness, efficiency, and mobile-first experience.
        *   **Feedback & Error Handling**: Implement a consistent and user-friendly system for notifications, alerts, and error messages across the entire application.
        *   **"Kenya-First" UX Deep Dive**: Conduct user research (if possible) to identify specific UX patterns or cultural considerations for Kenyan users and integrate them into the design.
        *   **Empty States & Loading States**: Design and implement clear empty states and comprehensive loading indicators for all data-driven views.

3.  **Performance & Optimization (Currently ~20% complete)**:
    *   **Current Status**: Basic component-level optimizations (like the one I just added to `Button`).
    *   **Remaining (80%)**:
        *   **Comprehensive Audit**: Perform a full performance audit (Lighthouse, Web Vitals) across the entire application.
        *   **Bundle Size Optimization**: Analyze and reduce JavaScript bundle size, optimize asset loading (images, fonts).
        *   **Rendering Performance**: Optimize React rendering performance across complex views.
        *   **Network Optimization**: Implement caching strategies, optimize API calls.

4.  **Accessibility (A11y) (Currently ~20% complete)**:
    *   **Current Status**: Basic accessibility considerations (e.g., `focus-visible` on buttons).
    *   **Remaining (80%)**:
        *   **Full Audit**: Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit against WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
        *   **Remediation**: Address all identified accessibility issues across the entire UI (keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast, ARIA attributes).

5.  **Testing & Quality Assurance (Currently ~30% complete)**:
    *   **Current Status**: Jest setup exists, some tests might be present (though linting showed many issues).
    *   **Remaining (70%)**:
        *   **Test Coverage**: Increase unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage for all critical UI components and user flows.
        *   **Visual Regression Testing**: Implement visual regression testing to prevent unintended UI changes.
        *   **Linting & Type Safety**: Systematically address all existing linting errors and warnings (especially `any` types) to enforce strict code quality.

**Overall Enterprise-Grade UI Completion: Approximately 30%**

## Enterprise-Grade Tooling Upgrades (Latest)

* **Storybook Setup:** Added `frontend/.storybook/` with `main.ts` and `preview.ts`. Created `button.stories.tsx` for `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
* **Package Scripts:** Extended `frontend/package.json` with `test`, `test:coverage`, `storybook`, `storybook:build`, and `perf:audit` scripts.
* **ESLint Accessibility:** Created `frontend/.eslintrc.json` with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` rules.
* **Performance Audits:** Added `frontend/lighthouserc.json` and `perf:audit` script (uses Lighthouse headless).
* **Dependency Watcher:** Added `ShujaaStudio/watchers/dep_watcher.py` to monitor Python + Node deps, prefer patch updates, and scan last 5 commits for recovery. Coordinates with `model_watcher.py`.
* **Next Steps:** Install Node deps, run tests and Storybook, and integrate CI for lint/test/a11y/perf.
