# Project State Analysis: Shujaa Studio

This document summarizes the current state of the Shujaa Studio project, reflecting its evolution towards an enterprise-grade AI video generation platform with a strong "Kenya-first" focus.

## 1. Introduction

Shujaa Studio is an offline-first AI video generator designed to empower African content creators. It transforms text prompts into engaging videos, complete with voice narration, visuals, and subtitles. The project prioritizes cultural relevance, local language support, and accessibility for users with limited internet connectivity.

## 2. Core Features & Capabilities

*   **Text-to-Video Generation:** Primary function to generate videos from user-provided text prompts.
*   **Offline First:** All core functionalities are designed to work without an internet connection.
*   **African-Centric Content:** Tailored to create culturally relevant content, focusing on local stories, languages, and contexts.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Video generation process is broken into modular components for flexibility and expansion.
*   **Web and CLI Interfaces:** User-friendly web interface (Gradio) and a command-line interface (CLI).
*   **Dynamic Multi-Provider AI Orchestration:** Intelligently routes AI generation requests (text, image, audio) across multiple providers (Hugging Face, Gemini, RunPod, local models, Colab, Kaggle).
*   **Intelligent Fallback Mechanism:** Robust fallback hierarchy (`Cache → HF → Gemini → RanPod → Local`) and multi-modal fallback.
*   **African Dialect Support & RAG:** Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enrich text generation with culturally accurate phrases and dialect-specific context.
*   **Pre- and Post-Generation Quality Assurance:** Checks before and after generation to assess prompt and content quality.
*   **Performance & Resource Analytics:** Detailed logging and storage of generation metrics.
*   **Modular Provider Integration:** Abstract `BaseProvider` and concrete implementations for easy addition/swapping of AI services.
*   **Centralized Router:** `backend/ai_routing/router.py` acts as a central hub for managing and dispatching requests.
*   **Cinematic Content Generation:** Dedicated module (`cinematic_africa.py`) to produce cinematic videos/audio from scripts in African dialects, with dialect-aware provider prioritization and automated rendering.
*   **PlanGuard Enforcement:** Global enforcement across all registries (models, TTS, widgets) at load, download, and runtime. Includes super admin bypass, graceful fallback, and admin notifications.
*   **Super Admin Dashboard:** Pluggable widget for comprehensive admin control (user/tenant management, model update approval, TTS voice management).
*   **User-Facing PlanGuard Dashboard:** Pluggable widget for users to monitor plan usage, view enforcement events, and access upgrade options.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
*   **Web UI:** React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
*   **Video Processing:** FFmpeg, MoviePy
*   **AI Models:** Mistral, LLaMA, Bark, XTTS, Coqui TTS, Stable Diffusion (SDXL, SD 1.5), Whisper
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (implied by Django ORM usage)
*   **Queueing:** Redis (for Celery/FastAPILimiter)

## 4. Target Audience

*   **Youth Content Creators:** Sheng cartoons, music videos, short stories.
*   **Civic Organizations:** Educational materials on anti-corruption, election processes, civic rights.
*   **Cultural Heritage Keepers:** Preserving and sharing folktales, legends, historical narratives.
*   **Educators:** Creating localized educational content and edutainment videos.
