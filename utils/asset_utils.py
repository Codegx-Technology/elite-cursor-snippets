    Conceptual function to generate a signed URL for an asset.
    In a real-world scenario, this would interact with a cloud storage SDK (e.g., boto3 for S3).
    
    Args:
        asset_path (str): The path to the asset (e.g., "videos/output.mp4", "images/image.jpg").
        expiration_minutes (int): How long the signed URL should be valid for in minutes.

    Returns:
        str: A conceptual signed URL.
    """
    # In a real implementation, this would involve:
    # 1. Authenticating with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
    # 2. Using the SDK's pre-signed URL generation method.
    # 3. Adding a secure signature and expiration timestamp.

    # For demonstration, we'll just append a conceptual signature and expiry.
