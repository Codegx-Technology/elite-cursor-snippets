## Frontend Testing Setup Issues

**Problem:**

I am encountering a persistent and critical error when attempting to install frontend dependencies (specifically for setting up testing) within the `frontend` directory. The error message is consistently:

`Directory 'frontend' is not a registered workspace directory.`

**Attempts Made:**

I have tried various methods to install the dependencies, including:

*   `npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom babel-jest ts-jest @types/jest`
*   `npm i -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom babel-jest ts-jest @types/jest`
*   Manually adding the dependencies to `frontend/package.json` and then running `npm install`.
*   Attempting to use `yarn install` as an alternative package manager.

In all cases, I have ensured that the commands are executed from within the `frontend` directory by using `cd frontend && ...`.

**Impact:**

This issue is a significant blocker for:

*   Setting up frontend testing (`phase3test` as per the `strategy_proposal.txt`).
*   Any further frontend development that requires the installation of new dependencies.

**Analysis:**

The persistence of this error across different package managers (`npm`, `yarn`) and various command syntaxes suggests that the problem is not with the package manager itself, but rather with how the execution environment or the project's structure is being perceived. It appears to be an issue related to workspace configuration or a similar environmental factor that prevents the package managers from correctly recognizing the `frontend` directory as a standalone project or a valid target for dependency installation.
