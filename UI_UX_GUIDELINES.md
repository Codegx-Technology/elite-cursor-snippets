# UI/UX Guidelines

This document outlines the design principles and standards for the Shujaa Studio user interface. The goal is to create a modern, user-friendly, and culturally relevant experience.

## 1. Design Philosophy

*   **Mobile-First:** The UI should be designed for mobile devices first and then enhanced for desktop use.
*   **GenZ Optimized:** The design should be modern, clean, and visually appealing to a younger audience.
*   **Kenya-First:** The UI should incorporate culturally relevant themes, colors, and imagery.
*   **Elite Experience:** The interface should have a premium feel with a focus on user experience and attention to detail.

## 2. Color Palette

The color palette is inspired by the vibrant colors of Africa and the modern aesthetics of GenZ design.

*   **Primary Gradient:** A gradient of purple and blue (`#667eea` to `#764ba2`) for primary actions and highlights.
*   **Secondary Gradient:** A gradient of gold and orange (`#ffd700` to `#ff8c00`) for secondary actions and special features.
*   **Text:** Charcoal grey (`#36454f`) for main text and a softer grey (`#6c757d`) for subtitles and secondary text.
*   **Background:** A clean white (`#ffffff`) or a subtle off-white gradient (`#f8f9fa`) for backgrounds.

## 3. Component Standards

*   **Headers & Titles:** Use clear and concise titles with a charcoal grey color and a font weight of 600.
*   **Cards & Containers:** Use rounded corners (16px) and a subtle box shadow to create a sense of depth. Add a hover effect to indicate interactivity.
*   **Buttons:** Use gradients for buttons to make them stand out. The primary button should use the primary gradient, and the elite button should use the secondary gradient.
*   **Form Inputs:** Use rounded corners (12px) and a subtle box shadow. Add a focus effect to indicate the active input field.

## 4. Responsive Design

The UI should be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

*   **Breakpoints:** Use standard breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
*   **Grid System:** Use a responsive grid system to arrange content. The number of columns should adapt to the screen size (e.g., 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, and 3-4 on desktop).

## 5. Animations

Subtle animations can be used to enhance the user experience.

*   **Transitions:** Use smooth transitions for hover and focus effects.
*   **Loading States:** Use a simple and elegant loading spinner to indicate that content is being loaded.
