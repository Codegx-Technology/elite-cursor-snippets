feat: Implement enterprise-grade UI fixes and enhancements

This commit addresses various linting errors, type safety issues, and UI/UX improvements across the frontend application. Key changes include:

- Refactored `dependencyGuard.ts` and `JobLogPanel.tsx` for improved type safety and React hook dependencies.
- Corrected conditional React Hook calls in `admin/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables in several page components (`admin/reporting/page.tsx`, `admin/tenants/page.tsx`, `admin/users/page.tsx`, `audio-studio/page.tsx`, `news-generate/page.tsx`, `projects/page.tsx`).
- Enhanced type safety in API routes (`api/generate/video/route.ts`, `api/jobs/[id]/route.ts`, `api/tiers/route.ts`, `api/tiers/subscribe/route.ts`, `api/videos/[id]/route.ts`) by replacing `any` types with specific interfaces and type guards.
- Fixed unescaped HTML entities in `login/page.tsx` and `pricing/page.tsx`.
- Updated `useUserManagement.ts` to use `useCallback` for its functions, improving performance and addressing `useEffect` dependency warnings.
- Integrated `PaginatedResponse` type in `api.ts` and `gallery/page.tsx` for consistent pagination handling.
- Added new ESLint configuration and Lighthouse setup for improved code quality and performance auditing.

These changes contribute to a more robust, maintainable, and enterprise-grade frontend experience.
