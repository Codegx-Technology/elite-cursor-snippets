feat: Implement Auto-Deploy & Provider Registration System

Implements the "Auto-Deploy & Provider Registration" system, centralizing provider setup and enabling one-line execution for notebooks.

- Created 'cloud_setup.py' to configure and return the 'Router' instance and its providers, centralizing provider setup.
- Modified 'backend/cloud_registry.py' to:
  - Import 'configure_providers' from 'cloud_setup.py'.
  - Initialize 'self.router' and 'self.providers' by calling 'configure_providers()'.
  - Implement 'list_providers()' to return names of configured providers.
  - Implement 'log_failure()' to log errors to a file.
  - Implement 'async execute()' method that leverages 'self.router.execute_with_fallback' for DRY principle, handling overall request routing and fallback.

This fulfills the "Auto-Deploy & Provider Registration" task.
