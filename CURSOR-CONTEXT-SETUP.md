# ðŸ§  Cursor Auto Context Setup Guide

## **Phase 7: Auto-Inject Local Context (Cursor Elite Mode)**

Enable Cursor to automatically load your project's unique context before responding â€” so it behaves like an embedded team member, not a generic assistant.

---

## âœ… **Step 1: Create prompt.context.yml**

**Location:** `C:\Users\LENOVO\Documents\ProjectsShared\salongenz\prompt.context.yml`

âœ… **Already created!** The file contains your project's:
- Project goals and objectives
- Technology stack and conventions
- Coding rules and best practices
- Kenya-specific requirements
- UI/UX principles
- Payment flow requirements
- Development workflow

---

## âœ… **Step 2: Enable Auto Context in Cursor**

### **Method 1: Command Palette**
1. Open Cursor
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open Command Palette
3. Type: `Toggle Inject Project Context`
4. Click to enable âœ…

### **Method 2: Settings**
1. Open Cursor Settings (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for "Inject Project Context"
3. Enable the experimental feature âœ…

### **Method 3: Settings JSON**
Add to your Cursor settings:
```json
{
  "cursor.experimental.injectProjectContext": true
}
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 3: Verify Context Loading**

### **Test Context Loading**
Ask Cursor: "What project am I working on?"

**Expected Response:** Cursor should mention SalonGenz, Kenya, salon booking platform, etc.

### **Test Context Awareness**
Ask Cursor: "What coding conventions should I follow?"

**Expected Response:** Should mention snake_case for Python, camelCase for JS, async/await, etc.

## ðŸš€ **Phase 7 Usage Examples**

### **When Coding:**
```
Given the context, fix this form logic without breaking validation or payment flow.
```

### **When Debugging:**
```
Fix this error in booking flow. Reminder: we use async/await and don't break existing UX.
```

### **When Refactoring:**
```
Refactor this page to be cleaner, but don't break login or appointment state â€” context loaded.
```

### **When Adding Features:**
```
Add a new payment method following our Kenya-specific requirements and security standards.
```

---

## ðŸ§  **Context-Aware Prompts**

### **Payment Integration:**
```
Following our payment flow context, implement M-Pesa integration with proper error handling.
```

### **UI/UX Development:**
```
Create a mobile-first booking form following our UI/UX principles and Kenya-specific requirements.
```

### **Backend Development:**
```
Implement the booking API following our Python conventions and security considerations.
```

### **Frontend Development:**
```
Build a React component for service selection following our frontend conventions and responsive design.
```
