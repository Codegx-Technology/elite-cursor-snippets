The arsenal is designed to be easy to learn and use. Instead of memorizing dozens of commands, you only need to remember **6 main category prefixes**.

**Step 1: Type a category prefix** in your code file to see the available options.

| **Core AI**  | `ai`       | Show all AI prompt options        |
| **Refactor** | `refactor` | Show all refactoring options      |
| **Daily**    | `daily`    | Show all daily companion options  |
| **Guardrails**| `guard`    | Show all guardrails options       |
| **Context**  | `context`  | Show all context chain options    |
| **Quick**    | `quick`    | Show most commonly used options   |

**Step 2: Press `Tab`** to see the list of available snippets in that category.

**Step 3: Choose a snippet** from the list, type its prefix, and press `Tab` again to expand the full prompt.
