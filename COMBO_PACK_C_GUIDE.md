```

### **Advanced Kenya-First Examples:**

```bash
# Educational story
python generate_video.py "Grace from Kibera dreams of becoming a software engineer. Despite challenges, she studies hard and gets a scholarship to Strathmore University. After graduation, she returns to start a coding school in her community, transforming hundreds of young lives through technology education."

# Community development story
python generate_video.py "In rural Turkana, water scarcity affects thousands of families. Young engineer Amina develops a solar-powered water purification system. Working with village elders and local youth, she installs the technology across multiple communities. Today, clean water flows freely, improving health and enabling children to focus on education instead of walking miles for water."

# Technology innovation story  
python generate_video.py "Kiprotich, a Maasai boy, discovers coding at age 15. Walking 20km daily to access internet, he teaches himself programming. His talent earns him a Nairobi scholarship. After graduation, he returns home to establish East Africa's first rural tech hub, training over 200 young programmers who create solutions for agriculture, healthcare, and education."
